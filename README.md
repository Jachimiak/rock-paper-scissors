# Rock, Paper, Scissors

---
This program simulates the Rock, Paper Scissor game using Javascript. It outputs all submissions into the console. As I built this project, I used come of the knowledge I had gained from working on freeCodeCamp and the new ideas from within The Odin Project.

Generally speaking, I had no issues regarding the design, though I did trip myself up on reading some of the instructions. One thing I will need to work on is taking my time when going over requests so that I don't miss anything important.
